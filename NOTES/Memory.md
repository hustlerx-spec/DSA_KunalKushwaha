a=10;
 There are 2  types of memory stack and heap.
a(ref variable) is stored in stack memory and object 10 is stored in heap memory.

more than one ref var can point towards the original object and if any one ref var change the object then the change will be visisble  for all others.

Garbage collection- objects with no ref var are removed from the memory .
